# Brief [!NOTE]
As a fellow senior student in Computer Science and owner of study groups on Telegram, I understand the challenges students face in grasping complex material.
Recognizing the need for personalized assistance, I created this tutorial.
Tailored for students seeking a personal LLM bot assistant, this project offers customization options for textbooks or PowerPoint slides.
It aims to revolutionize learning by providing intuitive guidance, explanations, resources, and even the ability to 
generate Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) or explanations on specific topics from the materials, enhancing comprehension and reinforcing key concepts for students
â€“ all from the material set for exams.
